					<p>These are just some instructions for getting your files together for your website so you can send them to me. Doing it this way just makes sure I know what order you want things in and makes everything usable with the website templates I've put together.</p>
					<p>Hopefully the pictures are enough to get you through most of this, but if anything's not making sense you can click on the text buttons for more info. And of course you can call me too.</p>

								<p>You will need to make a seperate text document for every folder that has images in it. If this text file is not included in a folder, the assumption will be that your work should have no accompanying information, which may be the case on pages like your "Home" or "Home Page."</p>

								<p>That's it for now, when you're site's ready to go we'll talk about linking this site to your official domain name ("www.tomchung.org" etc.).

								<p>My current preferance for registering website names is <a target="new" href="https://www.dreamhost.com/domains/">Dream Host</a>, but there are a lot of other good options including <a target="new" href="https://domains.google/#/">Google Domains</a> and <a target="new" href="https://www.godaddy.com/domains/domain-name-search">Go Daddy</a> which I still use sometimes.</p>
