					<p>I need your feedback! The details of these instructions are still being fine-tuned so any questions / feedback regarding sections needing clarification are greatly appreciated via email at tombetthauser@gmail.com (subject heading "AP Feedback").</p>
					<p>Hope this is at least semi-enjoyable!</p>
