					<h4>About this Site:</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Right now this site is just a hub for instructions and web templates that I've put together for a small group of family and friends. It exists to help you get me what I need so I can put together / update websites for you guys quickly and professionally. In the near future, I'm hoping to expand the site into a kind of donation-based Squarespace clone where you guys would be able to update your websites yourselves at home and maybe from your phones as well.</p>
					<p>If you're all ready for me to build a site for you, you can start by picking out a <a href="templates.html">Website Template</a> from the linked section above and then follow the <a href="getstarted.html">Instructions</a> also linked above. And if for any reason you feel inspired to contribute to help make the next version of the site happen (or you're just super happy with your website) you can always check out the <a href="contribute.html">Chip In</a> section too!</p>
<!-- 					<p>More on all that soon!</p>

<!-- 					<h4>Contact:</h4>
 -->				<!-- 	<p>If anything's not making sense or you catch any wierd bugs / silly spelling errors or you have any feedback at all on anything I appreciate any and all feedback and input at this point, so please feel super free to call me or email whenever.

					<p>You can email me at my normal address if that's easiest for you, but I also grabbed the artpages email below to help make sure emails about this project don't get lost in my normal chaotic inbox. Thanks in advance for your input!</p> -->

<!-- 					<p>This site (which has the working title "art-pages") is designed to act half as an ongoing front-end web development portfolio project and half as a functional resource for a handful of studio artist's.</p>
						<hr>
						<br>
					<div class="col-sm-6" id="t-section-sm">
						<h5>As a Web Development Project...</h5>
						<hr>
						<p>As a portfolio project, art-pages is designed to showcase basic proficiency in responsive mobile-first web design implementing Bootstrap 3.3.7.</p>
						<p>In the coming months the project will hopefully continue to expand into a showcase for proficiency in Bootstrap 4 and basic back-end development by incorporating an in browser user interface allowing studio artists to customize their own webpages and upload content independantly.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6" id="t-section-sm">
						<h5>As a Resource for Studio Artists...</h5>
						<hr>
						<p>As a resource for studio artists, art-pages is simply meant to streamline the process of making professional websites for artists.</p>
						<p>In it's current state artists who have been individually invited begin by organizing their portfolio content into a uniform file directory (folder) structure using the instructions on the <a href="getstarted.html"><em>Get Started</em></a> page linked above, then sending a compressed version of their organized content directly via email.</p>
						<br>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-12" id="t-section-sm">
						<h5>As a Donation-Based Service...</h5>
						<hr>
						<p>Although development of webpages for studio artists is usually provided by frelance developers at an hourly rate or by automated platforms like Square Space for a monthly rate, art-pages is a purely donation-based and has no manditory contribution for the original development or subsequent updates associated with an artist's website.</p>
						<p>Artists are asked to pay whatever they can whenever they can to support the project, and as it gains momentum, the contributions made will work directly towards the time and class-fees associated with the development of features that will streamline the process of building and maintaing the websites of all current and future participating artists.</p>
						<p>If the project stays financially viable the goal is to quickly develop an in-browser user interface (like that of Square Space, Other People's Pixels, Wix etc.) that will allow artists to re-design and add new content to their personal websites independantly, without the use of any direct knoledge of html/css.</p>
						<p>Thank you for visiting and thank you for your support!</p>
						<p>~ Tom <span class="hidden-xs"><i class="far fa-hand-peace"></i></span></p></p>
